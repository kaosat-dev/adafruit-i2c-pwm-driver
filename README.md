======================

Node.js implementation for the Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver
http://www.adafruit.com/products/815



Usage
-----
```coffeescript
var PwmDriver = require('adafruit-i2c-pwm-driver');
var pwm = new PwmDriver(0x40, '/dev/i2c-1');
var sleep = require('sleep');

var servoMin = 150;
var servoMax = 600;

while(true) {
  pwm.setPWM(4, 0, servoMin);
  sleep.sleep(1);
  pwm.setPWM(4, 0, servoMax);
  sleep.sleep(1);
  pwm.setPWM(4, 0, 0);
  sleep.sleep(10);
}
```

API
====

  - [PwmDriver(address:Number,device:String,debug:Bool)]

## PwmDriver(address:Number,device:String,debug:Bool)

Setting up a new PwmDriver

- address: Address of the i2c panel, e.g. 0x20
- device: Device name, e.g. '/dev/i2c-1' (defaults to /dev/i2c-1)
